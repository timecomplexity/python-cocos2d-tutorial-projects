# Python Cocos2d Tutorials

These are basic python projects using Cocos2d to create little games to show off what Cocos2d can do!

Mostly a little project to make myself learn Cocos2d and get better at python. Hopefully someone finds it helpful.

## Prerequisites

You're going to want to make sure that you have a few things.

```
[Get python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) first and foremost, this is what language we're making the games in.
[Get Pyglet](https://bitbucket.org/pyglet/pyglet/downloads) which is what Cocos2d is built upon.
[Get Cocos2d](https://github.com/adamwiggins/cocos2d) so we can use it in our games.
